# Hack Bulgaria Cinema Reservation System
We are going to the cinema! But the reservation systems are down and the cinema officials don't let people enter without reservations. So we offered to make them a new reservation system that will allow us to go and watch the newest **"Aliens came, we built transformers and destroyed them..."** movie.

## Problem 0 - The database
No complex stuff here. Just a few simple tables:

**Movies**

| id | name | rating |
| ------------- |:-------------| :---: |
|1|The Hunger Games: Catching Fire |7.9|
|2|Wreck-It Ralph|7.8|
|3|Her|8.3|

**Projections**

| id | movie_id | type | date | time |
| ---|----------|:----:| :--: | :--: |
|1|1|3D|2014-04-01|19:10
|2|1|2D|2014-04-01|19:00
|3|1|4DX|2014-04-02|21:00
|4|3|2D|2014-04-05|20:20
|5|2|3D|2014-04-02|22:00
|6|2|2D|2014-04-02|19:30

**Users**

| id | username | password |
| ---| ---------| :---------:|
|1|Rositsa Zlateva| ******** |
|2|Slavayana Monkova| ******** |
|3|Radoslav Georgiev| ******** |
|4|Krasimira Badova| ******** |
|5|Kiril Hristov| ******** |
|6|Vladimir Delchev| ******** |

! Passwords should be with length at least 8 symbols, 1 capital letter and a special symbol. Also, don't forget to hash the passwords!

**Reservations**

| id | user_id | projection_id | row | col |
| ---|----------|---------------|:----:|:---:|
|1|3|1|2|1|
|2|3|1|3|5|
|3|3|1|7|8|
|4|2|3|1|1|
|5|2|3|1|2|
|6|5|5|2|3|
|7|6|5|2|4|

**Things to note**
* For each projection we assume the hall to be a 10x10 matrix.
* All data presented here is just an example. If you want, you can make up your own data (perhaps you are the creator of the aforementioned movie and want to include it).

## Problem 1 - The CLI (Command-Line Interface)
We don't need no GUIs! A console with green text and transparent background is all a hacker requires.
Implement a script that takes magic commands and casts an appropriate spell. Here's an ancient page of Merlin's Book:
* On spell ```show movies``` - print all movies ORDERed BY rating
* On spell ```show movie projections <movie_id> [<date>]``` - print all projections of a given movie for the given date (date is optional).
  1. ORDER the results BY date
  2. For each projection, show the total number of spots available.

* On spell ```make reservation``` - It's showtime!
  1. Check if user logged
  2. If not, first action is to log the user into the system.
  3. If already logged, the user can make a reservation
  4. Make the hacker choose the number of tickets
  5. Cast ```show movies``` and make the hacker choose a movie by id
  6. Cast ```show movie projections``` for the chosen ```<movie_id>``` and make the hacker choose a projection
    * *If the available spots for a projection are less than the number of tickets needed, print an appropriate message and stay at step 6*;
  7. Cast a spell to show all available spots for the chosen projection
  8. For each number of tickets, make the hacker choose ```(row, col)```. Check or validity (10x10 matrix) and availability (reservations table)
  9. Cast a spell to show the info in an appropriate format. Then prompt for ```finalize``` spell
  10. On ```finalize``` spell, save all the info and wish a happy cinema!
  11. **At each step, allow for ```give up``` spell to be cast. This...wait for it...waaaiit... gives up the reservation!!!** (Thanks, cap'n)

* On spell ```cancel reservation <name>``` - disintegrate given person's reservation (**NOTE**: reservations cannot be so easily removed, but this is a magical system, after all)
* On spell ```exit``` - close Pandora's Box before it's too late.
* On spell ```help``` - show a list of learned spells


**Things to note**
* Notice how you are required to reuse code (or you'll be one messy hacker!!!).
* Try not to build everything in one place.
* Make use of the following techniques (Merlin used them to destroy the Decepticons): **OOP, TDD, SQL**.


## Problem 2 - Decorators

```python
@atomic
def show_movies():
    pass
```
We want you to implement a decorator for atomic transactions on each of the query you execute with the cinema application~

```python
@user_exists
def make_reservation(user, password):
    pass

```

If the user exists, make a reservation on its name. If not create a new user and a reservation for him.

```python

@validate_password
@hash_password
def set_password(password):
    pass
```

```python

@log_info
def finalize():
    pass
```
Log each reservation in the system.
